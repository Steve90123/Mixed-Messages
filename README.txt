Project outline: 

This is the first project I have created as a programmer. It is a simple mixed message project which aims to provide a random messages each time the programme is run. 

Topic for programme:

The programme will generate a different football team each time the programme is run. The goal is to help people decide which football team to support through a random generation from a choice of ten. 

Topic update 21/01/21 17:00

Programme updated to move to top three teams generated randomly from three seperate lists. This provides choice for the user of the programme as it will give them three teams to chose from.
